          "question": "Who's eligible?",
          "answer": "We accept teams of up to four students. Our student competition accepts up to forty teams and pits them against each other in one final battle. Teams do not need to be comprised of all students from the same school, but all participants must be actively enrolled in a college or university."

        {
          "question": "What do you need to know?",
          "answer": "All members should be proficient in the programming language their team intends to use. The API will use JSON messages passed over HTTP, so we recommend having knowledge of a JSON library in your chosen language."

        {
          "question": "What do you not need to know?",
          "answer": "No prior knowledge of any specific languages are required. You won't need a background in artificial intelligenceâ€”in previous years, many teams without an AI background have competed and done well, or even won. You also shouldn't need knowledge of network programming beyond HTTP requests."
        },
        {
          "question": "What can you bring?",
          "answer": "You can bring any reference manual(s) you wish, whether it be the Art of Computer Programming or the Art of War. But absolutely no outside code. You may, however, bring non-code items like rc files, build scripts, notes, etc. Competitors are required to bring their own laptops, though the code you write must be capable of running on our systems."
        },
        {
          "question": "What will you do?",
          "answer": "By either starting from scratch or using our provided sample clients, you will build an artificial intelligence client to play a strategy game of our design. Our API will provide you information about the current state of the game, as well as allow you to send commands to play it. You may find previous competition sites useful to get an idea of how MechMania operates."

          "answer": "PuzzleBang is a puzzle contest that takes place over the course of a week. Puzzles are released online at puzzlebang.com roughly one per day until Saturday when we release several hard puzzles and a physical, on-campus metapuzzle that pulls everything together.  In the last two years, PuzzleBang also included a real-life escape room (themed to, but otherwise unrelated to the puzzlebang.com puzzles)."

          "answer": "Anyone can play! We recommend teams of no more than four human beings. If you haven't met any other friends that are interested in playing, drop us a line at GameControl@puzzlebang.com and we'll see about pairing you up with a new friend or two."

          "answer": "Access to a functional human brain, an internet connection (ideally at or better than 28.8kb), and a computer with a good web browser. A mobile device (smartphone, laptop, tablet, dumbphone with a friend at a computer on the other end, etc) with internet capabilities might be useful for Friday and Saturday."
        },
        {
          "question": "What do you need to know?",
          "answer": "Everything! No, just kidding. Wikipedia's classical cipher's page might be useful. A number of letters in the alphabet, number of cards in a deck, all the US state abbreviations, and silly other things that you've probably run across in your daily life. Some awareness of the recent memes and popular culture will probably be helpful. Knowledge of current events at UIUC and the campus layout will be really helpful."
        },
        {
          "question": "What do you not need to know?",
          "answer": "How to code. It might be useful to be able to write a script to print out all the ways you can rearrange a set of letters, or apply different ciphers to them, but in general, you should be able to do everything by hand or ask Google and find a tool online to do it for you"

        {
          "question": "What is the motivation behind the ACM Symposium?",
          "answer": "The ACM Symposium is a way for us to return to our roots! R|P originated as the Midwestern ACM Chapter Conference back in 1995 and this year we are aiming to bring all our neighboring Midwestern chapters together to facilitate collaboration and conversation. All our chapters are doing incredible research and building really cool projects and we would be remiss if we couldn't shine a spotlight on it. Thus our tagline: Industry meets Academia!"
        },
        {
          "question": "Why should I attend?",
          "answer": "Well, for one, this is a great opportunity for our chapters to network, exchange ideas, learn and support one another! Second, your work gets more visibility. With an audience consisting of fellow ACM chapter members, students attending from 10+ midwestern universities, professors and researchers of UIUC themselves and other conference attendees and speakers, who know what opportunities might present themselves?"
        },
        {
          "question": "What am I allowed to showcase?",
          "answer": "SIG/ACM projects, individual/group projects or research, open source projects or contributions and anything in-between would be awesome to have at our project fair."
